# RAddin
Simple Excel-DNA based Add-in for handling R-scripts from Excel via shell or RdotNet, storing input objects (scalars/vectors/matrices) 
and retrieving result objects (scalars/vectors/matrices) as text files (currently restricted to tab separated) or RdotNet objects.
Graphics are retrieved from produced png files into Excel to be displayed as diagrams.
